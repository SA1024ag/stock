A liability takes money out of your pocket.\"** - Robert Kiyosaki\n\n### What is an Asset? 📈\nAnything that has value and can generate income or appreciate over time.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Stocks:** Pay dividends and grow in value\n- **Real Estate:** Pays rental income\n- **Bonds:** Pay interest\n- **Intellectual Property:** Royalties from books/patents\n\n### What is a Liability? 📉\nAnything that takes money out of your pocket, including expenses and debts.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Car:** Loses value (depreciation) + fuel + insurance\n- **Credit Card Debt:** High interest payments\n- **Subscription Services:** Monthly cash outflow\n- **Personal Loans:** Monthly EMI\n\n## The Rich vs. Poor Mindset\n\n- **The Poor:** Income → Expenses\n- **The Middle Class:** Income → Buy Liabilities (thinking they are assets, like a big house) → Expenses\n- **The Rich:** Income → Buy Assets → Assets generate more Income\n\n## Real-World Analogy\n\nThink of your finances like a **bucket**.\n- **Assets** are faucets pouring water (money) IN.\n- **Liabilities** are holes letting water (money) leak OUT.\n\nTo fill the bucket, you can either turn up the faucets (buy assets) or patch the leaks (reduce liabilities). Doing both is the fastest way to wealth!",

It is the secret weapon of all successful long-term investors.\n\n## How it Works\n\nImagine you invest **₹10,000** at **10%** interest.\n\n- **Year 1:** You earn ₹1,000. Total = ₹11,000.\n- **Year 2:** You earn 10% on ₹11,000 (not just the original ₹10k). That's ₹1,100! Total = ₹12,100.\n- **Year 3:** You earn 10% on ₹12,100. That's ₹1,210!\n\nOver 20-30 years, this snowball effect creates massive wealth.\n\n## The Power of Starting Early ⏰\n\n**Person A:** Starts investing at age 25, invests ₹5,000/month for 10 years, then STOPS.\n**Person B:** Starts at age 35, invests ₹5,000/month for 25 years.\n\n**Who has more money at age 60?**\nSurprisingly, **Person A** often wins! Because their money had 10 extra years to compound.\n\n## The Rule of 72\nA shortcut to calculate how long it takes to double your money.\n\n```\nYears to Double = 72 / Interest Rate\n```\n\n**Example:** At 12% return (typical Nifty 50 return), your money doubles in **72 / 12 = 6 Years**.\n\n## Key Takeaway\nYou don't need to be a genius to get rich. You just need **Time** and **Consistency**.",
